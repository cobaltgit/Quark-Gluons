-For best results after applying any theme, always restart the device
or it won't fully load.

-Both themes are complete, but come with their own caviots because of the Stock ui limitations.

-Cycle through looks with start button.

JC Zelda V2 (no restart required)-
-V2 was my attempt to get around the ui limitations. Less flair, less ui glitches.
-Switching from another theme requires you to cycle the look for it to load fully.
Tip: As long as you stay on this theme after restart, you can cycle looks and it wont glitch

Recommendation:
-Always restart after loading a new theme.
